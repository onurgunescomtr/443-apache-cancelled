# 443 for Apache 2.4
Cancelled Repo. Idea was preparing a local environment for modules, showing the structure how it basically forms requested URI responses, practical use.

## Lessons learned:
1. Using auto-edited, debugging type code or some old version to speed up things, is wrong. Bad reputation. People see it differently. Also waste of efford no matter how small or big.
2. Preparing a mid-level or entry-level accessible code should not be used for a whole project or its idea. Its wrong, even focus is on simplicity and target is beginners.
> It works for a month or two... Then people improve on language, it becomes a training.
3. Starters and researchers want to see a "boom! it works!" effect. Redirecting to "a get your key" is somewhat a barrier. Effects on interest negatively.
4. Even nobody knows the author, just a sole one person writing an idea, a nobody-cares code can be viewed/cloned many times. That guy/gal needs to put his/her best for whats put on public.
> I deleted most of my social media accounts (Twitter,Linkedin etc.), took a long break to get myself together after 05.03.2015. My life changed/nuked in 5 seconds at 31.12.2014.
5. Versioning the design sheet and putting that to real code makes confusion, for the author/creator too.
6. Learning things quickly does not make you an expert/master. I spent more than a decade on System Network, less on languages. Creating something for developer users makes a guru.
> Takes a lot of time and requires full hands-on/mind-on access to a language.
7. Like it or not, people tend to load/embrace a 700MB code even they only use ten percent of it, if its backed by marketing or decision-makers who has no idea what it is.
> Yea, everybody does it, why not you and other globally located thousand of employees...
8. Every line of code is written is a burden after a new major release. Future proof code takes a lot of time. Trying to accomplish that on full scope, is wrong. Makes you older.
> Delete and rewrite, or leave it there and renew.
9. It does not have to prove anything, be like fund backed startup or such.
10. Audience (even close ones) will be in need to see something they can understand some time after. No, logs dont count, console reporting its an up-to-date successful connection does not too. Auto-archiver for your own data solution? nah...
